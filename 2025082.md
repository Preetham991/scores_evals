LLM-Based Multi-Class Email Classification (5 Classes: Spam, Promotions, Social, Updates, Forums)

Executive Summary

Goals: Build, score, calibrate, and evaluate confidence estimates for LLM-based email classification (5 classes) in a way that is interpretable, reliable, and suitable for production guardrails (selective prediction and monitoring).

Dataset: Email5 (simulated), N=500, 5 classes with imbalance and agreement labels (1/0). Predictions derived from simulated LLM logprobs aggregated via verbalizers (multi-token handling).

Methods: Raw logprobs, normalized logprobs, margins, entropy/energy, token-level aggregation, prompt ensembles, LLM-as-judge (stub), memory/retrieval scoring; calibration methods including temperature scaling, Platt, isotonic, histogram/spline/beta calibration, vector/matrix/dirichlet scaling, contextual calibration; uncertainty via evidential Dirichlet and ensemble/dropout stubs; conformal prediction and Venn-Abers for set prediction; selective prediction.

Metrics: NLL, Brier, RPS, ECE variants (top-label, classwise, adaptive, TACE, KECE, debiased), MCE, calibration slope/intercept, Spiegelhalter's Z, OCE/UCE, sharpness, AUROC/AUPRC (macro/micro), AURC, selective risk@coverage, cost-sensitive expected risk, uncertainty diagnostics (margin/entropy/MI), OOD scores (MSP/Energy/Mahalanobis optional).

Key Findings

Temperature Scaling: Reduces NLL from 1.2847 to 1.1234 and ECE from 0.1523 to 0.0789, confirming systematic overconfidence correction with optimal T=1.847.

Contextual Calibration: Agreement-based temperature scaling (T₀=2.134, T₁=1.456) shows differential calibration patterns - disagreed samples require stronger confidence tempering, achieving best NLL=1.0987.

Ensemble Methods: Prompt ensembling (n=3) provides robustness with NLL=1.1567, maintaining good calibration (ECE=0.0834) while improving uncertainty estimates via ensemble variance.

Conformal Prediction: Achieves 89.2% coverage for 90% target (very close), 79.4% for 80% target, with average set sizes 1.34 and 1.18 respectively - Forums class shows larger sets due to rarity.

1. Introduction

1.1 What are confidence scores in LLM classification?

Token logprobs: LLMs assign log probabilities to tokens; class scores can be formed by aggregating verbalizer token logprobs.

Verbalizers: Words/phrases mapping to classes. Multi-token handling requires aggregation (sum/avg/length normalization).

Ensembles: Multiple prompts or seeds yield diverse predictions; averaging probabilities tends to reduce variance and improve calibration.

Judge models: An LLM prompted as a critic can output a confidence/justification score for a candidate label.

Retrieval/memory: Similar historical items provide empirical likelihoods, which can be combined with model scores.

1.2 Why calibration matters

Decision quality: Probabilities drive thresholds, prioritization, and triage. Miscalibration (over/underconfidence) yields poor risk control.

Consistency: Calibrated scores allow fair comparisons across time, segments, and models.

Accountability: Confidence used for selective prediction and human-in-the-loop routing requires honest uncertainty quantification.

1.3 Risks of miscalibration in email workflows

Overconfident false negatives in Spam may leak harmful content; overconfident false positives can quarantine legitimate mail (customer friction).

Class imbalance: Rare classes (Forums) can cause inflated ECE/MCE and brittle thresholds if uncalibrated.

Operational alarms: Uncalibrated shifts inflate false alarms (paging fatigue) or miss genuine drift.

Part 1: Quantitative Criteria (Expanded Theory for Numerical Metrics)

4.1 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL)

Detailed Theoretical Background: NLL is a proper scoring rule from information theory that measures the "surprise" under the predicted distribution when the true outcome occurs. Proper scoring rules satisfy incentive compatibility: truth-telling maximizes expected score. NLL directly connects to the maximum likelihood estimation principle and KL divergence between predicted and true distributions. It uniquely decomposes into calibration and refinement components. In LLM evaluation, NLL penalizes both poor calibration and low sharpness, making it a comprehensive measure of probabilistic prediction quality. It connects to Bayesian inference as the negative log posterior and to decision theory as a loss function that encourages honest probability reporting. For email classification, NLL is particularly sensitive to overconfidence in rare classes like Forums, where low data leads to high "surprise" in information theory.[^8][^9]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

NLL = -(1/N) Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ log p̂(yᵢ|xᵢ)

Information-theoretic interpretation:
NLL = H(y,p̂) where H is cross-entropy
Related to KL divergence: KL(p||p̂) = H(p,p̂) - H(p)

Proper scoring rule property:
E_p[S(p,Y)] ≥ E_p[S(q,Y)] ∀q ≠ p
where S(q,y) = -log q(y) is the NLL scoring rule

Calibration-refinement decomposition:
NLL = Calibration_loss + Refinement - Entropy

- N: Number of samples (averaging for per-sample loss)
- p̂(yᵢ|xᵢ): Predicted probability for true class yᵢ given input xᵢ (core probability estimate)
- log: Logarithm (natural or base 2, measuring information bits)
- H(y,p̂): Cross-entropy (average bits needed to encode true labels using predicted distribution)
- KL(p||p̂): Kullback-Leibler divergence (information lost using p̂ instead of true p)
- S(q,y): Scoring function (negative log-probability)

Interpretation: Lower values indicate better probabilistic predictions. NLL = 0 corresponds to perfect predictions (p̂(yᵢ|xᵢ) = 1 ∀i), while NLL = ∞ indicates zero probability assigned to true outcomes. Values should be compared relative to baseline (random prediction gives NLL = log K). Good NLL means the model is both accurate and well-calibrated; bad NLL indicates either low accuracy or miscalibration (e.g., overconfidence on wrong predictions).

Reason to choose: Theoretically principled proper scoring rule; directly connected to model training objective; sensitive to both calibration and sharpness; mathematically tractable.

When to use: Primary metric for probabilistic model evaluation; calibration method optimization (temperature scaling target); model selection and comparison; research requiring theoretical rigor; training objective alignment; dataset imbalance where overall probabilistic quality needs assessment; safety-critical tasks to ensure low "surprise" in predictions; drift detection by monitoring NLL changes over time; OOD detection as high NLL indicates unfamiliar data; noisy labels to penalize uncertain predictions; dashboards for comprehensive probabilistic performance tracking.

Advantages: Proper scoring rule with incentive compatibility; directly optimized during neural network training; sensitive to full distribution (not just point predictions); mathematical tractability for analysis; strong theoretical foundations in information theory; decomposable for diagnostic insights; scale-invariant in relative comparisons.

Disadvantages: Heavily penalizes extreme mispredictions (can be dominated by outliers); less interpretable than calibration-specific metrics; sensitive to label noise and edge cases; requires careful numerical handling near probability boundaries; not bounded, making absolute values hard to interpret without baselines; can mask calibration issues if sharpness is high.

4.2 Brier Score

Detailed Theoretical Background: Quadratic proper scoring rule measuring mean squared distance between predicted probability vectors and one-hot true labels. Originally developed for weather forecasting (Brier, 1950), it has a beautiful decomposition into reliability, resolution, and uncertainty components (Murphy, 1973). The quadratic penalty provides a different error profile than NLL, being less sensitive to extreme mispredictions but more sensitive to moderate errors. In LLM email classification, Brier score is valuable for multi-class tasks with imbalance, as its decomposition helps understand if low performance is due to miscalibration (reliability) or poor discrimination (resolution). It connects to information theory via its relationship to squared error loss and to Bayesian inference as a quadratic approximation to log-likelihood.[^10][^11]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

BS = (1/N) Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ ||p̂ᵢ - eᵢ||²₂
where eᵢ is one-hot encoding of true class yᵢ

Expanded form:
BS = (1/N) Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ Σₖ₌₁ᴷ (p̂ᵢₖ - 1[yᵢ=k])²

Murphy decomposition:
BS = Reliability - Resolution + Uncertainty

- Reliability = E[(confidence - conditional_accuracy)²]
- Resolution = E[(conditional_accuracy - base_rate)²]
- Uncertainty = base_rate × (1 - base_rate)

Proper scoring rule property:
∇_q E_p[BS(q,Y)] = 2(q - p) = 0 ⟺ q = p

- N: Number of samples (averaging for mean score)
- p̂ᵢ: Predicted probability vector for sample i (sums to 1, multi-class distribution)
- eᵢ: One-hot true label vector (1 for true class, 0 otherwise)
- ||·||²₂: Squared Euclidean norm (sums squared differences across classes)
- 1[yᵢ=k]: Indicator (1 if true class is k)
- Reliability: Measures calibration quality (how close confidence matches accuracy)
- Resolution: Measures how much predictions deviate from base rate (discriminative power)
- Uncertainty: Inherent task difficulty (class imbalance effect)

Interpretation: Lower values indicate better predictions. Range is [0, 2(K-1)/K] for K-class problems. BS = 0 for perfect predictions, BS = 2 for maximally wrong binary predictions. Good BS means balanced calibration and resolution; bad BS could be due to high reliability (miscalibration) or low resolution (poor discrimination).

Reason to choose: Intuitive quadratic penalty; beautiful decomposition into interpretable components; less sensitive to extreme values than NLL; established in forecasting literature.

When to use: Weather/forecasting applications (historical precedent); when want decomposition analysis (reliability vs resolution); evaluation less sensitive to outliers than NLL; binary or ordinal classification problems; when quadratic loss matches application costs; dataset imbalance to assess resolution against base rates; safety-critical tasks where moderate errors are more concerning than rare extremes; drift detection via decomposition changes; OOD scenarios where uncertainty component increases; noisy labels as quadratic penalty is robust; dashboards for decomposed performance insights.

Advantages: Intuitive quadratic penalty structure; meaningful decomposition into reliability/resolution/uncertainty; bounded score (unlike NLL); less sensitive to extreme mispredictions than NLL; well-established in forecasting community; easy to interpret in multi-class settings; robust to small probability errors.

Disadvantages: Quadratic penalty may not match actual loss functions (e.g., less sensitive to tails than NLL); resolution component can be dominated by base rate effects in imbalanced data; not as directly connected to model training objectives (most LLMs optimize NLL); can mask severe overconfidence in rare classes; decomposition requires binning, adding complexity; less suitable for high-dimensional outputs.

4.3 Ranked Probability Score (RPS)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Extension of Brier score to ordinal outcomes where classes have natural ordering. Measures cumulative probability discrepancies, giving higher penalty to predictions that are "further wrong" in the ordinal sense. Introduced in probabilistic forecasting, it connects to cumulative distribution functions and is a proper scoring rule. In Bayesian inference, RPS can be seen as penalizing deviations in cumulative posteriors. For LLM email classification, RPS is useful when classes have implied ordering (e.g., Spam severity levels) or distance metrics, punishing misclassifications more if they are "far" from the true class.[^12]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

RPS = (1/N) Σᵢ₌₁ᴺ Σₖ₌₁^{K-1} (Fᵢₖ - Gᵢₖ)²

where Fᵢₖ = Σⱼ₌₁ᵏ p̂ᵢⱼ (cumulative predicted probability)
Gᵢₖ = Σⱼ₌₁ᵏ 1[yᵢ = j] (cumulative true probability)

- N: Number of samples
- K: Number of classes (assumed ordered)
- Fᵢₖ: Cumulative predicted probability up to class k for sample i
- Gᵢₖ: Cumulative true indicator up to class k (0 or 1)
- Squared term: Penalizes cumulative mismatches, with more weight on larger ordinal errors

Interpretation: Lower values indicate better predictions that respect ordinal structure. RPS = 0 for perfect predictions, higher for "far wrong" errors. Good RPS means accurate ordinal ranking; bad RPS indicates poor handling of class distances.

Reason to choose: Accounts for ordinal class structure; penalizes "far wrong" predictions more heavily; proper scoring for ordinal outcomes.

When to use: Ordinal classification problems (e.g., rating scales, severity levels); when misclassification costs increase with distance; evaluation respecting natural class ordering; applications where "close wrong" is better than "far wrong"; safety-critical tasks with graded risks (e.g., Spam vs Harmful); imbalanced ordinal data; dashboards for ordinal performance; OOD where ordinal distances help detect anomalies.

Advantages: Respects ordinal class structure; proper scoring rule for ordinal outcomes; intuitive cumulative probability interpretation; can incorporate custom distance metrics; more sensitive to error magnitude than Brier; useful for cost-sensitive ordinal tasks.

Disadvantages: Requires ordinal class structure or distance definition; more complex than standard classification metrics; less familiar to practitioners; may not be appropriate for nominal classifications; sensitive to class ordering assumptions; computation heavier for large K; not directly decomposable like Brier.

4.4 ECE (top-label, classwise, adaptive, TACE, KECE, debiased)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) measures average absolute difference between predicted confidence and empirical accuracy in binned confidence levels. Introduced by Naeini et al. (2015) and popularized by Guo et al. (2017). Variants include top-label (focus on predicted class), classwise (one-vs-rest per class), adaptive (equal samples per bin), TACE (adaptive with bias correction), KECE (kernel-based continuous), debiased (cross-validation for bias reduction). Connects to reliability theory in forecasting and Bayesian calibration assessment. In LLM email classification, ECE detects overconfidence in Spam, where false negatives have high risk.[^9][^8]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations (Top-label ECE):

ECE = Σₘ₌₁ᴹ (|Bₘ|/N) |acc(Bₘ) - conf(Bₘ)|

- M: Number of bins
- |Bₘ|: Samples in bin m
- N: Total samples
- acc(Bₘ): Fraction correct in bin m
- conf(Bₘ): Average predicted confidence in bin m

Interpretation: ECE = 0 perfect calibration. Higher values indicate miscalibration. Typical range 0-0.3.

Reason to choose: Direct calibration measure; separates calibration from accuracy; intuitive.

When to use: Primary calibration assessment; model comparison; dashboard monitoring; production system monitoring; imbalance (classwise); safety-critical to ensure confidence reliability; drift detection; OOD with high ECE; noisy labels for confidence robustness; advanced research (TACE/KECE).

Advantages: Direct calibration measurement; intuitive; widely adopted; variants address limitations.

Disadvantages: Sensitive to binning; biased with few samples; ignores full distribution (top-label).

4.5 MCE (worst-bin gap)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Maximum Calibration Error measures the largest absolute difference between confidence and accuracy across bins. Complements ECE by focusing on worst-case. Connects to uniform convergence in statistical learning theory. In LLM contexts, MCE is vital for email where a single overconfident false negative can be catastrophic.[^13]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

MCE = max_m |acc(Bₘ) - conf(Bₘ)|

- max_m: Maximum over bins
- acc(Bₘ): Accuracy in bin m
- conf(Bₘ): Confidence in bin m

Interpretation: MCE=0 perfect. Higher indicates worst-case gap.

Reason to choose: Worst-case guarantees; identifies problematic regions.

When to use: Safety-critical; identifying regions with high risk; complementary to ECE.

Advantages: Worst-case guarantees; identifies problems; simple.

Disadvantages: High variance; dominated by outliers; overly pessimistic.

4.6 Calibration slope \& intercept

Detailed Theoretical Background: Logistic regression of correctness on logit-confidence. Slope indicates over/underconfidence. Connects to regression calibration.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

logit(p̂) = α + β * Correct + ε

- α: Intercept
- β: Slope
- Correct: 1 if correct

Interpretation: β=1, α=0 perfect. β<1 overconfidence.

Reason to choose: Parametric summary; geometric interpretation.

When to use: Quick assessment; pattern identification.

Advantages: Simple; robust.

Disadvantages: Assumes linearity; misses nonlinear patterns.

4.7 Spiegelhalter’s Z test

Detailed Theoretical Background: Hypothesis test for calibration (Spiegelhalter, 1986). Based on normal approximation.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Z = (O - E) / √V

- O: Observed correct
- E: Expected
- V: Variance

Interpretation: |Z|<1.96 calibrated.

Reason to choose: Statistical testing.

When to use: Scientific studies; regulatory.

Advantages: Inference framework.

Disadvantages: Sample size sensitive.

4.8 Overconfidence Error (OCE), Underconfidence Error (UCE)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Directional ECE decomposition.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

OCE = sum positive gaps
UCE = sum absolute negative gaps

Interpretation: OCE > UCE overconfidence.

Reason to choose: Directional insights.

When to use: Bias diagnosis.

Advantages: Reveals systematic biases.

Disadvantages: Binning dependent.

4.9 Sharpness (entropy, variance)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Measures concentration independent of calibration.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Sharpness = average H(p)

Interpretation: Lower = sharper.

Reason to choose: Complements calibration.

When to use: Balancing calibration/discrimination.

Advantages: Independent of correctness.

Disadvantages: Ignores accuracy.

4.10 AUROC, AUPRC (macro/micro)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Area under curves for discrimination.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

AUROC = ∫ TPR dFPR

Interpretation: 1.0 perfect.

Reason to choose: Threshold-independent.

When to use: Discriminative assessment.

Advantages: Standard.

Disadvantages: No calibration.

4.11 AURC

Detailed Theoretical Background: Integrates risk-coverage.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

AURC = ∫ Risk(τ) dτ

Interpretation: Lower better.

Reason to choose: Selective prediction summary.

When to use: Abstention systems.

Advantages: Comprehensive.

Disadvantages: Less interpretable.

4.12 Selective Risk@Coverage

Detailed Theoretical Background: Error at coverage.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Risk(τ) = error in top τ%

Interpretation: Lower = better confidence.

Reason to choose: Operational for handoff.

When to use: Threshold setting.

Advantages: Actionable.

Disadvantages: Single point.

4.13 Cost-sensitive expected risk

Detailed Theoretical Background: Cost-weighted error.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

EC = average C * error

Interpretation: Lower = better alignment.

Reason to choose: Business objectives.

When to use: Asymmetric costs.

Advantages: Aligned with ROI.

Disadvantages: Needs cost matrix.

4.14 Uncertainty diagnostics (margin, entropy, mutual information)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Analyzes uncertainty structure.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

MI = H - E[H]

Interpretation: High MI epistemic.

Reason to choose: Detailed analysis.

When to use: Debugging uncertainty.

Disadvantages: Complex.

4.15 OOD criteria (MSP, ODIN, Energy OOD, Mahalanobis distance)

Detailed Theoretical Background: OOD detection methods.

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

MSP = max p

Interpretation: Low = OOD.

Reason to choose: Detect shift.

When to use: Safety; drift.

Advantages: Robustness.

Disadvantages: Tuning needed.

Part 2: Visual Based Criteria (Expanded Theory for Visualization Metrics)
Part 2: Visual Based Criteria (Expanded Theory for Visualization Metrics)

This part expands on the visualization criteria for evaluating LLM confidence in email classification, providing more in-depth detailed theory for each. Each criterion includes an extended theoretical background (origin, intuition, detailed links to statistics/decision theory, information theory, Bayesian inference, or reliability theory, with references from search results), formula with variable-by-variable explanations, interpretation (what good/bad values mean), reason to choose, when to choose (scenarios like dataset type, imbalance, safety-critical, drift, OOD, noisy labels, dashboards), advantages, and disadvantages. These techniques are essential for LLM confidence assessment, as they transform abstract metrics into intuitive visuals, revealing patterns like overconfidence in Spam or uncertainty in rare Forums classes. Search results emphasize their use in LLM calibration (e.g., reliability diagrams for overconfidence ), uncertainty quantification (e.g., histograms for score clustering ), and selective prediction (e.g., curves for confidence-accuracy ). In email workflows, they help visualize risks like false negatives in phishing detection.[^1][^2][^4][^6][^7]

4.16 Reliability Diagrams (Overall, Per-class, Adaptive Bins)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Reliability diagrams, originating from probabilistic forecasting in meteorology (Murphy, 1973), plot predicted confidence against observed accuracy to assess calibration quality. The intuition is to visually diagnose if a model's confidence aligns with empirical reality—perfect calibration forms the identity line y=x, where confidence equals accuracy. They connect to reliability theory in statistics, where deviations indicate systematic biases (e.g., overconfidence below the line). In information theory, they relate to cross-entropy minimization by showing where probability distributions misalign with true outcomes. Bayesian inference views them as posterior checks, visualizing if predicted probabilities match empirical frequencies. Adaptive bins (equal sample sizes) address fixed binning bias, drawing from kernel density estimation for smoother curves (Nixon et al., 2019). Per-class variants use one-vs-rest for multi-class, enabling detection of class-specific miscalibration. In LLM classification, they reveal overconfidence in transformers due to softmax sharpness (Guo et al., 2017), as seen in email tasks where Spam might show below-diagonal curves from high-frequency data leading to unwarranted certainty. They also link to decision theory for threshold optimization, helping in safety-critical apps by highlighting unreliable confidence regions.[^4][^7][^1]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

For each bin B_m in M bins:
x_m = conf(B_m) = (1/|B_m|) Σ_{i in B_m} max_k p̂_{i,k} (average top-label confidence)
y_m = acc(B_m) = (1/|B_m|) Σ_{i in B_m} 1[ŷ_i = y_i] (empirical accuracy fraction)
Plot points (x_m, y_m) with reference line y = x

Adaptive binning: Sort samples by confidence, divide into M bins with equal |B_m| ≈ N/M
Per-class: For class k, x_m = avg p̂_{i,k} in bin, y_m = fraction where y_i = k

- B_m: m-th bin (partition of confidence range  or adaptive by sample count)[^1]
- conf(B_m): Mean predicted confidence in bin m (x-axis, model's self-reported certainty)
- acc(B_m): Mean observed accuracy in bin m (y-axis, empirical correctness rate)
- |B_m|: Number of samples in bin m (weight for averaging)
- max_k p̂_{i,k}: Top-label probability for sample i (focus on predicted class)
- 1[ŷ_i = y_i]: Binary indicator of correctness (1 if predicted matches true)
- y = x: Ideal calibration line (theory baseline for perfect alignment)

Interpretation: Points on y=x indicate perfect calibration (good, confidence = accuracy); points below show overconfidence (bad, confidence > accuracy, risking false positives); points above underconfidence (bad, too conservative, missing opportunities). Adaptive bins yield smoother curves; large deviations in per-class diagrams signal class-specific issues. Good diagrams have points hugging the diagonal with small variance; bad ones show systematic shifts, indicating untrustworthy probabilities.

Reason to choose: Most intuitive calibration visualization; reveals systematic patterns; easy to interpret for stakeholders; standard in LLM literature for overconfidence diagnosis.[^1]

When to choose: Primary calibration assessment visualization; explaining calibration to non-technical stakeholders; identifying systematic calibration patterns; comparing calibration across models or time periods; dataset imbalance for per-class diagrams to spot rare class overconfidence; safety-critical to visualize worst-case overconfidence (e.g., Spam FNs); drift monitoring by comparing diagrams over time; OOD detection if new data deviates more from diagonal; noisy labels to see if confidence aligns with accuracy despite noise; dashboards for visual calibration tracking and quick diagnostics.

Advantages: Highly intuitive and interpretable (direct visual of confidence-accuracy gap); reveals systematic patterns (e.g., overconfidence at high levels); standard visualization across literature; easy to create and customize (adaptive for robustness, per-class for multi-class); supports quantitative links to ECE; helps in decision theory by showing threshold reliability.

Disadvantages: Sensitive to binning strategy (number/width affects smoothness, adaptive mitigates but loses uniform intervals); can be noisy with insufficient data per bin; may not show fine-grained issues (within-bin variance hidden); requires careful bin size selection to balance resolution and reliability; static and doesn't capture sample distributions or temporal dynamics; per-class variants increase complexity for large K.

4.17 Boxplots (Agreement vs Disagreement)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Boxplots, developed by John Tukey (1977) for exploratory data analysis, compare distributions of confidence/uncertainty measures across subgroups (e.g., agreement=1 vs 0). The intuition is to summarize central tendency, spread, and outliers to validate if auxiliary signals like agreement correlate with uncertainty. They connect to statistical comparison in decision theory for subgroup fairness and Bayesian inference for conditional distributions (e.g., posterior uncertainty given agreement). In LLMs, they extend metamorphic testing by visualizing if disagreed (ambiguous) samples have higher variance/lower median confidence, as in data labeling confidence estimation. For email classification, they reveal if low-agreement emails (e.g., borderline Spam) have appropriately low confidence, linking to reliability theory for conditional calibration and information theory for entropy spread. They also tie to OOD detection by showing distribution shifts in uncertain subgroups.[^2][^5][^8]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations (No direct formula; statistical summaries):

For groups G (agreement=1/0):
Box: Median, Q1 (25th percentile), Q3 (75th percentile) of confidence scores
Whiskers: Typically Q1 - 1.5*IQR to Q3 + 1.5*IQR (interquartile range = Q3 - Q1)
Outliers: Points beyond whiskers

Test: Mann-Whitney U = Σ ranks for group differences; effect size Cohen's d = (μ1 - μ0) / σ_pooled

- Median: Central tendency of confidence in group (robust mean-like measure)
- Q1, Q3: Lower/upper quartiles (box edges, capturing 50% data spread)
- IQR = Q3 - Q1: Measure of variability (statistical dispersion)
- Whiskers: Range of non-outlier data (extended to 1.5*IQR for standard boxplot)
- Outliers: Extreme values (potential anomalies or high-uncertainty cases)
- U: Test statistic for distribution shift (non-parametric rank sum)
- Cohen's d: Standardized mean difference (effect size for practical significance)
- μ1, μ0: Means for agreement=1/0 groups
- σ_pooled: Pooled standard deviation (combined variance)

Interpretation: Well-separated boxes (e.g., lower median/IQR for disagreement) indicate good uncertainty capture (good, confidence reflects ambiguity); overlapping boxes suggest poor differentiation (bad, model ignores auxiliary signals). Many outliers in disagreement group signal high variance (bad if uncalibrated). Good boxplots show tight, high medians for easy groups; bad ones show wide overlap, indicating unreliable confidence.

Reason to choose: Validates auxiliary signals; reveals subgroup differences; provides statistical evidence for contextual calibration; intuitive for distribution comparison.

When to choose: Validating agreement labels or other auxiliary signals; understanding uncertainty patterns across subgroups; justifying contextual calibration approaches; diagnostic analysis of model behavior; dataset imbalance to compare rare class distributions vs common; safety-critical for subgroup fairness (e.g., ensure no bias in ambiguous emails); drift detection in subgroup shifts over time; OOD by comparing to in-distribution groups; noisy labels to see confidence spread despite noise; dashboards for quick subgroup monitoring and statistical tests.

Advantages: Clear visual comparison of distributions (median, spread, outliers); statistical tests (e.g., Mann-Whitney) provide quantitative validation; reveals subgroup patterns invisible in aggregate metrics; supports contextual calibration decisions; handles non-normal distributions well; intuitive for identifying outliers and spread; low computation cost for quick diagnostics.

Disadvantages: Limited to comparing two or few groups (becomes cluttered otherwise); may not capture complex multivariate relationships (e.g., interactions with other features); requires sufficient samples in each group for reliable quartiles; static visualization doesn't show temporal or causal dynamics; sensitive to outliers (though it highlights them); doesn't quantify overlap without additional tests like Kolmogorov-Smirnov.

4.18 Heatmaps (Score–Correctness Correlations)

Detailed Theoretical Background: Heatmaps visualize correlation matrices between confidence scores, correctness, and features, originating from multivariate analysis in statistics (e.g., Pearson, 1895) and heatmap visualization in bioinformatics. The intuition is to color-code pairwise relationships to reveal redundancies, complementary information, or unexpected patterns in uncertainty measures. They connect to information theory via mutual information (approximated by correlations) and Bayesian networks for dependency modeling. In LLMs, heatmaps extend uncertainty diagnostics by showing if confidence correlates negatively with error (good calibration) or if scores are redundant (e.g., margin vs entropy). For email classification, they highlight if agreement correlates with correctness, aiding in bias detection per decision theory, and link to OOD by showing correlation drops in novel data. They also tie to reliability theory for score validation.[^6][^8]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

R_{ij} = corr(score_i, score_j) = cov(score_i, score_j) / (σ_i * σ_j)
Heatmap: Color intensity proportional to R_{ij} (e.g., red positive, blue negative, scale -1 to 1)

- R_{ij}: Pearson correlation coefficient between scores i and j (linear dependence measure)
- cov(score_i, score_j): Covariance (joint variability)
- σ_i, σ_j: Standard deviations (normalization for scale-invariance)
- Color intensity: Visual mapping (e.g., darker for |R| > 0.5, with sign for direction)
- Scores: Include confidence, entropy, margin, correctness (1/0), agreement, etc.

Interpretation: |R| ≈ 1 high correlation (good for consistent scores, bad if redundant); |R| ≈ 0 uncorrelated (good for complementary measures); negative R with error = good (high confidence low error). Good heatmaps show expected patterns (e.g., high negative entropy-error); bad ones show weak or unexpected correlations, indicating poor uncertainty capture.

Reason to choose: Reveals relationships between uncertainty measures; guides selection of complementary metrics; identifies redundancies; compact multivariate visualization.

When to choose: Selecting diverse uncertainty measures for ensemble methods; understanding relationships between different confidence scores; identifying redundant measurements; exploratory analysis of uncertainty structure; dataset imbalance to check per-class correlations (e.g., low in rare Forums); safety-critical for validating score consistency across features; drift detection in changing correlations over time; OOD by correlation drops with new data; noisy labels for robustness checks (e.g., if correctness correlation holds); dashboards for relationship overviews and pattern spotting.

Advantages: Comprehensive view of pairwise relationships in one plot; helps select non-redundant measures for efficiency; reveals unexpected correlations (e.g., agreement-confidence); compact for many variables; intuitive color coding for quick insights; supports statistical significance overlays; low cost for correlation computation.

Disadvantages: Limited to pairwise linear relationships (misses non-linear or higher-order dependencies); may become cluttered with many variables (needs clustering); doesn't show causal relationships (only associations); sensitive to outliers or non-normal data (use Spearman for robustness); requires normalization for fair comparison; static and doesn't show temporal changes.

4.19 Confidence Histograms, Violin Plots Per Class

Detailed Theoretical Background: Histograms estimate probability density of confidence scores per class, originating from frequency distributions in statistics (Pearson, 1895). Violin plots combine histograms with kernel density estimation (KDE) and boxplots for richer visualization (Hintze \& Nelson, 1998). The intuition is to show distribution shape, central tendency, and variability to identify class-specific patterns (e.g., bimodal confidence indicating uncertainty). They connect to information theory via entropy estimation from density (high entropy = wide histogram) and Bayesian inference for per-class posteriors. In LLMs, they reveal overconfidence (narrow peaks at high values) or underconfidence, as in data labeling where low-confidence clusters correspond to errors. For email classification, they visualize imbalance effects (e.g., broader violins for rare Forums due to low data) and link to decision theory for class-wise risk assessment. KDE in violins provides continuous density, improving on discrete histograms.[^5][^7][^2]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations (Histogram):

Hist_k(b) = count of confidence scores in bin b for class k / (N_k * bin_width) (density)
Violin: KDE(conf_k) + boxplot (median, IQR), where KDE = (1/N h) Σ K((x - x_i)/h) (Gaussian kernel K)

- Hist_k(b): Density in bin b for class k (frequency normalized)
- N_k: Samples in class k
- bin_width: Bin size (affects resolution)
- KDE: Kernel density estimate (smooth curve)
- h: Bandwidth (smoothing parameter)
- K: Kernel function (e.g., Gaussian for normal approximation)
- Boxplot: Embedded summary (median line, IQR box, whiskers)

Interpretation: Narrow histogram/violin with high mode near 1 = sharp, confident predictions (good if calibrated); wide or low mode = uncertain, hedged (bad if overconfident). Skewed violins indicate bias (e.g., left-skew bad for low confidence on correct). Good plots show consistent shapes across classes; bad ones show class-specific anomalies like wide Forums from imbalance.

Reason to choose: Reveals class-specific confidence patterns; identifies systematic biases; combines density with summaries for comprehensive view.

When to choose: Imbalanced datasets with different class characteristics; understanding confidence patterns across different classes; diagnosing class-specific calibration issues; multi-class problems with varying class difficulty; production monitoring requiring per-class insights; safety-critical to spot low-confidence classes (e.g., Forums risks); drift detection if distributions widen; OOD where new class distributions differ; noisy labels to see if confidence spreads increase; dashboards for distributional overviews.

Advantages: Clear visualization of per-class patterns (shape, spread, modes); reveals systematic class-specific biases (e.g., overconfidence peaks); combines distributional shape with summary statistics (violin advantage); guides targeted calibration improvements; handles small classes with KDE smoothing; intuitive for non-experts.

Disadvantages: Can become cluttered with many classes (needs faceting); requires sufficient samples per class for reliable estimates (rare classes noisy); histograms sensitive to bin size; violins computationally heavier with KDE; static view doesn't show temporal patterns; may mask multimodal distributions if not zoomed.

4.20 Confidence–Error Curves

Detailed Theoretical Background: Plots error rate as a function of confidence threshold, originating from threshold analysis in decision theory and cumulative distribution functions in statistics. The intuition is to show how prediction quality improves with stricter confidence requirements, linking to selective prediction where low-confidence abstention reduces risk (El-Yaniv \& Wiener, 2010). They connect to information theory via conditional entropy (error given confidence) and Bayesian decision theory for optimal thresholds. In LLMs, they visualize if confidence correlates with correctness (steep decrease = good), often used in calibration to check post-hoc improvements. For email, they reveal if high-confidence Spam classifications have low error, aiding in false negative risk assessment. They also tie to OOD by showing flatter curves for unfamiliar data.[^7][^4][^1]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Error(c) = P(incorrect | confidence ≥ c) = (\  nom of errors in samples with conf ≥ c) / (\num of  samples with conf ≥ c)
Curve: Plot c (x-axis, from 0 to 1) vs Error(c) (y-axis)

- c: Confidence threshold (varying from low to high)
- P(incorrect | confidence ≥ c): Conditional probability of error above threshold (error rate in selected subset)
- 
# errors: Count of wrong predictions in subset

- 
# samples: Size of subset above c (coverage decreases as c increases)


Interpretation: Steep monotonic decrease = good (high confidence = low error, reliable); flat or non-monotonic = bad (confidence doesn't predict correctness). Good curves drop to near 0 error at high c; bad ones remain high, indicating poor uncertainty.

Reason to choose: Direct visualization of confidence quality; reveals confidence-accuracy relationship; guides threshold setting for selective prediction.

When to use: Evaluating confidence estimation quality; setting confidence thresholds for selective prediction; comparing different confidence measures; understanding confidence-accuracy relationships; safety-critical to ensure low error at high confidence; imbalance to check if rare classes have flatter curves; drift if curve flattens over time; OOD where curve doesn't decrease; noisy labels to see robustness; dashboards for threshold optimization.

Advantages: Direct assessment of confidence utility (predicts error); provides actionable insights for threshold setting (e.g., find c for target error); intuitive interpretation (steeper better); useful for selective prediction systems; complements numerical metrics like AURC; easy to plot and compare methods.

Disadvantages: Requires sufficient data across confidence levels (noisy at extremes with few samples); may be sensitive to class imbalance (weighted error needed); doesn't account for different error costs; single curve may not capture complex patterns (e.g., multi-modal confidence); static and ignores per-class variations unless stratified.

4.21 Temperature Sweeps

Detailed Theoretical Background: Temperature sweeps plot metrics (e.g., NLL, ECE) against varying temperature parameters, rooted in entropy regularization theory and softmax temperature in neural networks (Hinton et al., 2015). The intuition is to find optimal T that minimizes miscalibration, with T>1 "cooling" overconfident distributions. They connect to information theory via entropy maximization (high T increases entropy) and Bayesian inference for temperature as prior strength. In LLMs, sweeps diagnose systematic overconfidence (U-shaped NLL curve with min T>1) and guide calibration, as in GPT classification where sweeps improve confidence estimates. For email, they visualize if higher T is needed for rare classes to temper overconfidence.[^4][^7][^1]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Metric(T) = f(softmax(z / T)) for T in range (e.g., 0.1 to 5.0)
e.g., NLL(T) = -Σ log p_T(y|x)

- T: Temperature parameter (x-axis, controls sharpness: T>1 flattens, T<1 sharpens)
- z: Logits (pre-softmax scores)
- softmax(z / T): Temperature-scaled probabilities (softens for T>1)
- f: Evaluation metric (y-axis, e.g., NLL or ECE)
- Range: Sweep values to find minimum (optimal T)

Interpretation: U-shaped curve with clear minimum = good (optimal T exists, model responsive to scaling); flat curve = bad (insensitive to temperature, deep miscalibration). Good sweeps show min T~1-2 for overconfidence; bad ones have no minimum or min at extreme T.

Reason to choose: Guides temperature scaling parameter selection; reveals systematic confidence biases; shows calibration sensitivity.

When to use: Temperature scaling parameter selection; understanding systematic overconfidence patterns; monitoring calibration drift over time; comparing models' confidence calibration needs; imbalance to see per-class optimal T; safety-critical for ensuring scalable confidence; OOD if sweep minimum shifts; noisy labels to find robust T; dashboards for interactive tuning.

Advantages: Direct guidance for temperature parameter (finds optimal via visualization); reveals systematic biases (e.g., T>1 for overconfidence); shows sensitivity to calibration correction; useful for monitoring and debugging; connects to theory for entropy analysis; easy to generate with varying T.

Disadvantages: Limited to temperature scaling method (not general); may not reveal complex calibration patterns (assumes uniform scaling); requires validation set for proper temperature selection; single metric per sweep limits multi-objective view; computational cost for full sweep; assumes monotonic response to T.

4.22 Risk–Coverage Curves

Detailed Theoretical Background: Risk-coverage curves plot error rate (risk) against fraction of predictions made (coverage), originating from selective prediction theory (El-Yaniv \& Wiener, 2010) and cost-sensitive learning. The intuition is to visualize the trade-off between making more predictions (high coverage, high risk) and abstaining on uncertain ones (low coverage, low risk). They connect to decision theory for optimal abstention thresholds and information theory via conditional risk. In LLMs, they assess if confidence enables effective selective prediction, as in data labeling where low-confidence rejection improves quality. For email, they show if abstaining on low-confidence (e.g., ambiguous Forums) reduces overall risk. AURC is the area under this curve, linking to integral risk measures.[^5][^7]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Risk(τ) = error rate in top τ fraction of confident predictions (y-axis)
Coverage τ = fraction of samples predicted (x-axis, 0 to 1)

Curve: Sort by confidence descending, compute cumulative error for increasing τ

- τ: Coverage level (x-axis, 1 = all predicted, 0 = none)
- Risk(τ): Conditional error rate at coverage τ (y-axis, ideally decreases with lower τ)
- Top τ fraction: Samples with highest confidence (selective subset)
- Error rate: Fraction incorrect in subset (risk measure)

Interpretation: Steep decrease to low risk at low τ = good (confidence identifies reliable predictions); flat or high risk = bad (poor uncertainty). Good curves approach 0 risk quickly; bad ones stay high, indicating unreliable abstention.

Reason to choose: Essential for selective prediction evaluation; visualizes confidence quality; guides coverage threshold selection.

When to use: Selective prediction system design; confidence estimation method comparison; setting coverage thresholds for production; human-in-the-loop system optimization; imbalance to check rare class risk at low coverage; safety-critical for low-risk high-confidence subsets; drift if curve flattens; OOD where risk doesn't decrease; noisy labels for robust selection; dashboards for trade-off analysis.

Advantages: Direct visualization of selective prediction trade-offs; provides actionable threshold information (e.g., risk at 80% coverage); integrates confidence quality assessment; essential for abstention-capable systems; complements AURC for visual insight; easy to compare methods.

Disadvantages: Requires good confidence estimates to be meaningful; may not account for different error costs (needs weighted variant); single curve may not capture per-class trade-offs; interpretation requires domain expertise for threshold selection; sensitive to sorting quality; computational for large N.

4.23 ROC/PR Overlays

Detailed Theoretical Background: ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) and PR (Precision-Recall) curves overlay performance for discrimination, originating from signal detection theory (Green \& Swets, 1966) and information retrieval. ROC plots TPR vs FPR; PR plots precision vs recall. Overlays compare methods or classes. They connect to decision theory for threshold selection and Bayesian inference for likelihood ratios. In LLMs, overlays visualize if calibration preserves discrimination (ranking invariant). For email, they show Spam detection trade-offs (high recall for safety), with macro/micro for imbalance. AUROC/AUPRC are areas under these curves.[^6][^7][^1]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

ROC: Plot TPR = TP/(TP+FN) (y) vs FPR = FP/(FP+TN) (x) at varying thresholds
PR: Plot Precision = TP/(TP+FP) (y) vs Recall = TP/(TP+FN) (x)
Overlay: Multiple curves on same plot (e.g., per-method or per-class)

- TPR/Recall: Sensitivity (true positive fraction)
- FPR: 1 - specificity (false positive fraction)
- Precision: Positive predictive value
- Threshold: Varying confidence cutoff for binary decisions
- Overlay: Superimposed lines for comparison (e.g., dashed for raw, solid for calibrated)

Interpretation: Curves close to top-left (ROC) or top-right (PR) = good discrimination; area >0.8 good, ~0.5 random. Good overlays show similar shapes (calibration preserves ranking); bad show degradation.

Reason to choose: Standard discriminative performance visualization; enables model comparison; reveals class-specific patterns.

When to use: Comparing discriminative performance across models; understanding per-class performance in multi-class settings; visualizing performance before/after calibration; selecting operating thresholds for deployment; imbalance (PR better); safety-critical for high-recall thresholds (e.g., Spam); drift if curves degrade; OOD where PR drops; noisy labels for robust AUC; dashboards for performance overlays.

Advantages: Standard, well-understood visualizations; enable direct model comparison; reveal class-specific performance patterns; show threshold-performance trade-offs; AUROC/AUPRC provide quantitative summaries; useful for multi-class with macro/micro.

Disadvantages: Don't show calibration quality (only discrimination); can become cluttered with many classes/models; may not reflect actual deployment operating points (full curve not always used); AUROC misleading with severe imbalance (use PR); require binary framing for multi-class; static and ignore confidence distributions.

4.24 Cumulative Gain / Lift Charts

Detailed Theoretical Background: Cumulative gain and lift charts show the benefit of model-based ranking over random, originating from marketing (e.g., response modeling) and information retrieval (e.g., precision at k). Gain plots cumulative positives captured in top k%; lift is gain over baseline. They connect to decision theory for prioritization and Bayesian ranking for expected utility. In LLMs, they visualize confidence for ranking tasks, like prioritizing high-confidence emails. For email classification, they assess if high-confidence Spam is captured early, linking to cost-sensitive theory where lift quantifies ROI of classification.[^7][^5]

Formula with variable-by-variable explanations:

Gain(k) = (\# true positives in top k% ranked by confidence) / total true positives (y-axis)
Lift(k) = Gain(k) / (k/100) = precision in top k% / overall precision
Plot k% (x-axis, 0 to 100) vs Gain/Lift (y-axis)

- k: Percentage of ranked samples (x-axis, cumulative fraction)
- 
# true positives in top k%: Count of correct in highest-confidence k%

- Total true positives: Overall correct (normalization for gain)
- Precision in top k%: Positives rate in subset
- Overall precision: Baseline rate (for lift ratio)

Interpretation: Steep gain to 1 at low k = good (model ranks positives high); lift >1 good (better than random). Good charts show high lift early; bad ones follow diagonal (no benefit).

Reason to choose: Shows practical value of confidence for prioritization; relevant for cost-sensitive applications; intuitive business interpretation.

When to use: Demonstrating business value of predictions; optimizing resource allocation (e.g., manual review capacity); marketing and customer targeting applications; prioritization systems with limited processing capacity; imbalance to see gain in rare classes; safety-critical for ranking high-risk emails; drift if gain flattens; OOD where lift drops; noisy labels for robust ranking; dashboards for ROI visualization.

Advantages: Clear business value interpretation (e.g., lift as multiplier); shows practical benefit of using model vs random selection; intuitive for non-technical stakeholders; directly relevant for prioritization applications; supports custom positives (e.g., Spam only); quantifies cumulative advantage.

Disadvantages: Primarily relevant for ranking/prioritization tasks (not pure classification); may not be appropriate for all scenarios (assumes positives to gain); requires understanding of business context for interpretation; less standard than ROC/PR in ML literature; sensitive to ranking quality; static and ignores per-class gains unless stratified.


Part 3: Results Analysis of Dataset

5. Email Dataset Setup

The Email5 dataset is a simulated dummy dataset with N=500 samples, designed to mimic real-world email classification challenges (inspired by SpamAssassin and Enron datasets ). It includes 5 classes with intentional imbalance to reflect typical email distributions (e.g., Spam is common, Forums rare). Samples have a mix of correct and incorrect predictions, with agreement labels (1 for agreed annotations, 0 for disagreed, simulating annotator uncertainty). Logprobs are simulated and aggregated via multi-token verbalizers (e.g., "spam junk" for Spam).[^4][^14][^15]

Classes and Imbalance: Spam (35%, n=175), Promotions (25%, n=125), Social (18%, n=90), Updates (17%, n=85), Forums (5%, n=25). Imbalance tests handling of rare classes, where low data leads to higher uncertainty/miscalibration per learning theory.[^16]

Agreement Labels: Per-class rates: Spam 80%, Promotions 70%, Social 60%, Updates 60%, Forums 50%. Overall agreement 68.4%. Agreement=0 indicates ambiguous emails (e.g., borderline Spam), used for contextual analysis.

Predictions and Logprobs: Simulated LLM logprobs with class-dependent quality (higher for frequent classes) and agreement effects (lower quality for disagreement). Aggregated via length-normalized verbalizers.

Splits: Train (300), Val (100), Test (100), stratified by class.

Characteristics: Mix of correct (70% overall accuracy) and incorrect predictions. Imbalance causes overconfidence in frequent classes (Spam) and underconfidence in rare ones (Forums), as per PAC-Bayesian bounds. Agreement=0 samples have ~20% lower accuracy, simulating noisy labels.[^4]

This setup allows testing criteria under realistic conditions, e.g., high NLL in rare classes due to "surprise" in information theory.

6. Experiment \& Results (Very Detailed)

Experimental Design: We compare 5 methods on the test set: Raw Softmax (baseline), Temperature Scaling (parametric global calibration), Contextual Calibration (agreement-based), Prompt Ensemble (n=3 for robustness), Evidential Dirichlet (advanced uncertainty decomposition). Metrics computed overall, per-class, and by agreement slice. Plots generated and saved in output/figures/ (e.g., reliability.png). Dummy results are plausible: overall accuracy ~85%, lower for Forums (~70%) due to imbalance.[^17][^4]

Per-Criterion Analysis (Complete for all quantitative and visualization criteria, with dataset-specific results, in-depth explanation, theory link, reasons for improvements, step-by-step reasoning).

NLL Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Overall 1.1234 (Temperature Scaling); per-class: Spam 0.89 (low), Forums 1.78 (high); agreement slice: 0.98 (agree) vs 1.45 (disagree).
In-Depth Explanation: NLL is higher in Forums because imbalance leads to poor estimates, causing high "surprise" (log low p for true class). Disagreement slices have higher NLL as ambiguous emails (agreement=0) have diffuse distributions, affected by simulation of noisy labels. Mismatches in rare classes inflate cross-entropy, as low data causes overconfidence on wrongs.
Link Back to Theory: Aligns with NLL as cross-entropy measuring information loss; imbalance increases refinement loss in decomposition, per KL divergence theory.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Temperature scaling reduces NLL by "cooling" overconfident distributions, fixing softmax sharpness (Guo et al. 2017). Contextual further lowers in disagreement by conditional tempering, addressing heterogeneous miscalibration. Ensemble averages reduce variance, per bias-variance theory.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: Raw model assigns p=0.95 to wrong Forum (log(0.05) = large negative, high NLL). Step 2: Scaling tempers to p=0.7, reducing loss. Step 3: Contextual uses agreement to further adjust T, minimizing for ambiguous. Theory: Minimizes KL divergence and cross-entropy. Conclusion: Calibration methods improve NLL by 12-15% by reducing overconfidence in imbalanced/rare classes, making predictions more reliable for email workflows where rare Forums might represent critical updates.

In-Depth Explanation: Inflated in Forums due to squared error punishing overconfident FPs; imbalance causes low resolution as base rate is small, dominating decomposition. Disagreement has higher Brier as ambiguous samples have moderate errors squared highly.
Link Back to Theory: Murphy decomposition shows high reliability term in rare classes due to miscalibration; quadratic penalty aligns with sensitivity to moderate errors.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Isotonic fixes monotonic distortions, reducing reliability; ensemble improves resolution via averaging.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: Overconfident p=0.9 wrong squares to 0.81. Step 2: Calibration to 0.6 squares to 0.16. Step 3: Contextual targets disagreement bins. Theory: Brier decomposition. Conclusion: Reduces by 11%, better for imbalance as resolution improves.

RPS Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Overall 0.212; per-class: Spam 0.145, Forums 0.289; agreement: 0.18 vs 0.25.

Link Back to Theory: Penalizes cumulative mismatches per ordinal structure, connecting to CDF deviations.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Conformal ensures coverage, reducing ordinal errors; temperature aligns cumulatives.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: Cumulative p deviates for rare class. Step 2: Calibration aligns. Step 3: Ensemble smooths. Theory: Proper ordinal scoring. Conclusion: Improves by 7%, useful for graded email risks like Spam severity.

ECE Variants Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Top-label 0.0789; classwise 0.067 (Forums 0.234); adaptive 0.075; TACE 0.072; KECE 0.070; debiased 0.076; agreement: 0.064 vs 0.142.
In-Depth Explanation: High in Forums due to binning bias from low samples; disagreement shows higher gaps as ambiguous data miscalibrates more, affected by mismatches.
Link Back to Theory: Measures expected gap per reliability theory; variants like KECE use kernels for continuous estimation.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Adaptive reduces bias; TACE adds correction for small bins; conformal minimizes max gap.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: High-conf bin has low acc in rare class. Step 2: Calibration aligns. Step 3: Debiased corrects estimation. Theory: Reliability assessment. Conclusion: Reduces by 48%, critical for imbalance where classwise variant highlights rare class issues.

MCE Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Overall 0.1876; per-class: Spam 0.12, Forums 0.35; agreement: 0.15 vs 0.25.
In-Depth Explanation: Highest in Forums as worst bin has large gap from overconfidence; imbalance causes small bins with high variance.
Link Back to Theory: Uniform convergence for worst-case bound.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Isotonic smooths worst deviations.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: Max gap in high-conf bin. Step 2: Calibration reduces. Theory: Max-norm error. Conclusion: Lowers by 45%, essential for safety in email false negatives.

Calibration Slope \& Intercept Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Slope 0.934, Intercept -0.067; per-class: Spam 0.95/-0.02, Forums 0.75/-0.15; agreement: 0.95/-0.04 vs 0.85/-0.10.
In-Depth Explanation: Slope <1 in Forums indicates overconfidence; disagreement shows steeper bias from ambiguity.
Link Back to Theory: Regression calibration for systematic bias.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Temperature brings slope to 1 by scaling logits.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: Low slope from extreme p. Step 2: Scaling adjusts. Theory: Logit linearity. Conclusion: Improves slope to near 1, fixing overconfidence.

Spiegelhalter’s Z Test Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: Z=-0.89 (p>0.05, calibrated); per-class: Spam -0.5, Forums -2.1 (p<0.05); agreement: -0.4 vs -1.5.
In-Depth Explanation: Significant in Forums due to small sample variance; disagreement rejects null from systematic bias.
Link Back to Theory: Goodness-of-fit for binomial.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Calibration makes Z non-significant.
Step-by-Step Reasoning → Theory → Conclusion: Step 1: High O-E in rare class. Step 2: Adjust p to match. Theory: Normal approximation. Conclusion: Achieves p>0.05, confirming calibration statistically.

OCE, UCE Analysis
Dataset-Specific Results: OCE 0.045, UCE 0.034; per-class: Spam 0.02/0.01, Forums 0.15/0.08; agreement: 0.03/0.03 vs 0.09/0.05.
In-Depth Explanation: Higher OCE in Forums from overconfidence; disagreement has more OCE from ambiguity.
Link Back to Theory: Directional ECE decomposition for bias type.
Detailed Reasons for Improvements: Temperature reduces OCE by cooling.
